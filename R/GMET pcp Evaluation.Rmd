**Purpose:** In this page, we have all the script for evaluation of GMET precipitation dataset against the local observations over Bolivia territory. All different steps are coded from reading the GMET.nc files and preparing the reference time series, to all different statistical and categorical analysis. Each step will come with seperate explanation at the begining and detailed description at each line. It is possible to adjust this script for other gridded precipitation estimation products and other case study regions.  

*Important:* Be sure to do all the following initial setups before running the code...

> **Initial setups**  

make needed adjustments and then excute these lines:
```{r}
rm(list=ls()) # removes variables from environment
dir_main <- "https://github.com/seiwater/Gridded-precipitation-validation" # set the main directory in your computer
dir_GMET <- "Z:/Data/NCAR_GMET/GMET_grids/GMET_daily" # set the GMET.nc (netCDF large files) directory
dir_in <- "https://github.com/seiwater/Gridded-precipitation-validation" # set the input directory in your computer
```

Now we have set our main, GMET, and our input directory. So, it is time to put some data files into the input directory. Lets move on by the following steps: 

* Copy and paste the "Coordinates_FileXY.csv" file, into your input directory. You can find it [here](https://github.com/seiwater/Gridded-precipitation-validation/tree/master/Inputs).  
* Copy and paste the "pcp txt files" folder into your input directory. You can find it [here](https://github.com/seiwater/Gridded-precipitation-validation/tree/master/Inputs)  

*Great!*  
by executing the following lines, R will organize some sub-folders in your main directory for your convenience!  
```{r eval=FALSE}
dir.create(paste(dir_main,"/Outputs", sep = ""), showWarnings = FALSE) # 'output' folder is created under the dir_main directory
dir_out <- paste(dir_main,"/Outputs", sep = "") # set output directory
dir.create(paste(dir_out,"/Stats", sep = ""), showWarnings = FALSE) # 'Stats' folder is created under the dir_out directory
dir_stats = paste(dir_out,"/Stats", sep = "") # set Stats directory
dir.create(paste(dir_out,"/Categorical Eval", sep = ""), showWarnings = FALSE) # 'Categorical Eval' folder is created under the dir_out directory
dir_cat = paste(dir_out,"/Categorical Eval", sep = "") # set cat directory
dir.create(paste(dir_out,"/In Pixel Uncertainty", sep = ""), showWarnings = FALSE) # 'In-Pixel Uncertainty' folder is created under the dir_out directory
dir_unc = paste(dir_out,"/In Pixel Uncertainty", sep = "") # set unc directory
```

Here, we will install all needed packages (if they are not already installed) and call their library:    

```{r message=FALSE}
pkg = c("xlsx", "ncdf4", "ggplot2", "maps", "xtable", "knitr", "plotrix", "reshape2", "kableExtra", "magrittr", "sp", "geosphere",  "gridExtra")
new.pkg = pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages())]
if (length(new.pkg)) {
    install.packages(new.pkg)
}

library(xlsx)
library(ncdf4)
library(ggplot2)
library(maps)
library(knitr)
library(xtable)
library(plotrix)
library(reshape2)
library(kableExtra)
library(magrittr)
library(sp)
library(geosphere)
library(gridExtra)
```

*Wonderful!* We are now all set. Lets enjoy doing the calculations...  

# Section 1: Finding pixels that include Gauge stations
Please keep in mind that the GMET gridd file is huge and reading data of all its pixels would result in taking a lot of memory. On the other hand, when we don't have gauge observations for those pixels, so ther will be no point in reading them. Therefore, the objective of this section is to find the pixels that include at least one gauge station. Then we can just extract the data and time series of those pixels.  
```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd(dir_GMET)
# ncname <- list.files(pattern = ".nc") # Should you have different .nc files with different names, use this line. 
ncname <- c("BoliviaGMET_Daily_EnsembleMean.nc") # introduce the name of GMET.nc, if you know it. Otherwise use the previous line
ncf <- nc_open(ncname)
lat <- ncvar_get(ncf, "latitude")
lon <- ncvar_get(ncf, "longitude")

setwd(dir_in)
Gauge_inf = read.csv("Coordinates_FileXY.csv", header = TRUE)

Pixel_Ga <- as.data.frame(matrix(data = NA, nrow = length(Gauge_inf[,1]), ncol = 7)) # create a matrix to store pixel ID of the pixels that correspond to each Gauge
colnames(Pixel_Ga) <- c("STNID", "LatG", "LonG", "P_ID1", "P_ID2", "GMET_lat", "GMET_lon") # P_ID1: 1st dimension of lat/lon variables ----- P_ID2: 2nd dimension of lat/lon variables
Pixel_Ga[,1:3] = Gauge_inf[,1:3]

for (g in 1:length(Gauge_inf[,1])) # loop on the number of gauge stations in Gauge_inf object 
{
    v1 <- Gauge_inf[g,2]
    v2 <- Gauge_inf[g,3]
    id = which((lat - 0.025) <= v1 & (lat + 0.025) > v1 & (lon - 0.025) <= v2 & (lon + 0.025) > v2)
    id1 = which((lat - 0.025) <= v1 & (lat + 0.025) > v1 & (lon - 0.025) <= v2 & (lon + 0.025) > v2 , arr.ind=TRUE)[1]
    id2 = which((lat - 0.025) <= v1 & (lat + 0.025) > v1 & (lon - 0.025) <= v2 & (lon + 0.025) > v2 , arr.ind=TRUE)[2]
    
    Pixel_Ga[g,4] <- id1 # 1st dimension of the lat & lon matrices which corresponds to raws and Long
    Pixel_Ga[g,5] <- id2 # 2nd dimension of the lat & lon matrices which corresponds to columns and Lat
    if (length(id) == 0) {
        # in this case, this gauge is out of the window of the produced GMET pixels
        Pixel_Ga[g,6] = NA
        Pixel_Ga[g,7] = NA
    } else {
        Pixel_Ga[g,6] = lat[id]
        Pixel_Ga[g,7] = lon[id]
    }
}

outG = which(is.na(Pixel_Ga$P_ID1)) # Gauges out of the GMET window
Pixel_Ga = Pixel_Ga[-outG,] # the gauges at this line are out of the window of GMET pixels and their values returned NA. So these are omitted

#Saving the Pixel_Ga Dataframe
setwd(dir_out)
save(Pixel_Ga, file = "Pixel_Ga_LatLon.RData")
```

Now we want to create a simple map of Bolivia including the location of rain gauge stations in and outside of the country that are used in GMET algorithm.  
```{r}
setwd(dir_out)
load("Pixel_Ga_LatLon.RData")
map.text("world",c("Bolivia","Brazil","chile","paragu","argen","peru"), xlim = c(-73,-52), ylim = c(-25,-8))

text(-69,-23,"Chile",cex = 0.8)
text(-64,-24,"Argentina",cex = 0.8)
points(Pixel_Ga$LonG,Pixel_Ga$LatG,col=4,pch=16,cex = 0.5)

# Section 2: Preparing the GMET time series

# Section 3: Distances between each gauge and its pixel center
The objective of this section is to find the pixels that include one or more gauge stations. Then, it is needed to calculate the distance between each gauge and the center of its pixel so that later, this distances can be used to calculate the average value of observations at that pixel. Note that we need only one reference dataset for each pixel, to easily compare it with the GMET estimated time series.

Aim of this section is to average the guage values for each pixel and make the reference dataset for each GMET pixel and then produce Reference Vs GMET time series. Here we want to make the timeseries of reference dataset plus the GMET dataset and insert in the AllD list. In stations with just  one guage in them, no averaging is needed but for those with more than one, we should get the average of observed values in all gauges that exist in the pixel, by using IDW method and distances which can be found in pi_ga data.frame.

This graph also illustrates that GMET is doing well in reproducing the monthly variation of local observations.  
  
# Section 10: Scatter Plot 
If we consider each GMET estimation and its equivalent observed value as a pair of estimation-observation data, it is also useful to plot all data pairs in a scatter plot and evaluate the overall correlation of the model. This is the purpose of this section which means making two time series, one for the GMET and the other for reference observations and plot them against each other.  
```{r eval=FALSE}
pairData = function(AllD){
    allpairs = NULL
    for (i in 1:length(AllD[,1]))
    {
        Data = AllD[[i,2]]
        allpairs = rbind(allpairs, Data)
    }
    return(allpairs)
}
```
the 'paiData' is a function for making the needed time series for a scatter plot which can both be called for daily, or monthly data.  

**IMPORTANT NOTE**  
*Running this function for the Daily data will take a long time since the plot will be a super heavy graph with lots of points. So after execution of the next command line ('menu' command line), choosing the "Daily" option is not recommended though the "Monthly" one is also time-consuming enough.*

This monthly scatter plot is showing that the correlation coefficient of the total set of data is about 84% with a R2 value of 0.77. The fact that the trend line fitted to the GMET estimation values versus observed data is so close to the perfect agreement line (dashed line) indicates the level of accuracy in the GMET model and its algorithm.  
  
# Section 11: Statistical Analysis (Daily, Monthly, Seasonal)
For the statistical validation, we used the coefficients of correlation coefficient (CC), mean bias error (MBE), square root error (RMSE), RMSE coefficient of variation (CV-RMSE) and absolute mean error (MAE), to evaluate performance of GMET rainfall estimations over the study area. These evaluations can be calculated at daily, monthly scales and in seasonal or non-seasonal scenarios. Therefore, the purpose of the following chunk is to calculate all these measures for the GMET dataset.

Now lets see some of the statistical results. We start by taking a look at the daily statistical measures.  
```{r}
    setwd(dir_stats)
    load(file = "Statistical_Measures_Daily.RData")
    # summerize the data and make Table:
    Avg = colMeans(stats)
    Min = apply(stats,2,min)
    Max = apply(stats,2,max)
    Tbl_stD = data.frame(Min=round(Min,2), Avg=round(Avg,2), Max=round(Max,2), row.names = colnames(stats))# Table_Stats_Daily: Tbl_stD
    
    # this table will be shown in R Markdown when converting to an HTML file
    kable(Tbl_stD,format = "html", caption = "Table of Daily Statistical Measures") %>%
        kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
```
In this table the MBE can be observed from -263 to 70%, with an average of -4.34%. The correlation coefficient is also changing from 0.12 to 0.95, with an average of 0.65 for the daily data set. The average correlation of 0.65 in daily scale shows the efficiency and good performance of GMET model in estimating the precipitation over Bolivia. MAE values are changing from  0.28 to maximum 11.00 with an average of 2.00 mm/day. This means that on average the GMET estimate has about 2 mm/day difference from observations.  

Now, lets take a look on monthly statistical measures:  
```{r}
    setwd(dir_stats)
    load(file = "Statistical_Measures_Monthly.RData")
    # summerize the data and make Table:
    Avg = colMeans(stats)
    Min = apply(stats,2,min)
    Max = apply(stats,2,max)
    Tbl_stD = data.frame(Min=round(Min,2), Avg=round(Avg,2), Max=round(Max,2), row.names = colnames(stats))# Table_Stats_Monthly: Tbl_stD
    
    # this table will be shown in R Markdown when converting to an HTML file
    kable(Tbl_stD,format = "html", caption = "Table of Monthly Statistical Measures")%>%
        kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
```
Here in the monthly scale evaluations the bias is reduced to 4.66% which is a positive sign. Likewise, the correlation coefficient increased with respect to that of the daily table while its average value is approximately 0.90 for the whole region. The RMSE, CV-RMSE and MAE metrics have also decreased. In general, monthly statistical measures indicate a very good performance of GMET over the country of Bolivia, which proves that it is an appropriate rainfall product to be used in a hydrological model.

These graphs are showing the seasonal differences of statistical measures for daily and monthly time series. These figures show that while in most evaluation pixels, GMET estimations are highly correlated with observation rainfall time series, there are still some pixels in where their correlation coefficient are lower. This is especially observed during the dry season at which some of the observations even have negative correlation. This indicates that more attention should be given to GMET estimates in the dry season. You can have similar interpretations from other graphs and analyse these results.  

# Section 12: Systematic and Random Error (Daily, Monthly, Seasonal)  
The mean-square difference (MSD) measure can describe the difference between observed and estimated rainfall rates, just as it makes it possible to calculate the division between the components of systematic and random errors. SO, the purpose of this chunk is to calculate the systematic and random error components of the estimation model. In order to do that, we should initially perform a linear regression over the GMET-Gauge data, calculate MSD error and then based on the Sys-Rand formula we can calculate the systematic and random error components.

These results indicate that around 46% and 33% (Daily and Monthly) of the associated errors with GMET estimations are caused by issues in the system of estimation and the rest is due the random errors. This actually means that the GMET algorithm is well adjusted (specially at monthly scale) so there is not a serious need for calibration of the main GMET algorithm and methodology. In other words, the majority of the estimation errors are caused by the natural uncertainties dealing with precipitation phenomena, which is hard to remove and also can possibly be originated from the imperfect observations in the local gauge stations and the issues of comparing a gridded product with point reference dataset.

# Section 13: Categorical Evaluations
Purpose of this script is to do the categorical analysis for the GMET Vs Gauge observation rainfals. Firstly, by testing different intervals for categories, the best interval values for the categories and for classification of observation rainfals are defined. Then, frequency distribution of GMET and Obs. are calculated at each category. Afterwards, the index of Reliability on GMET estimations is also calculated at different categories.  

* Defining the limits of categories:
This must be done by looking at the frequency distribution of observation pcp data, so it can't be automated. However, you can  initially check the values by writing: breaks = seq(0.0, upl, by=5), and then check the "obs.freq" table values to see how we can define the intervals. It is better to define the intervals in a way that they almost include same number of events (except the first [0-1) intervals which always include more than all others). On the other hand, these intervals must be hydorlogically logical and  justifiable.

```

and here is the graph we produced using the above table:  
![](https://github.com/seiwater/Gridded-precipitation-validation/blob/master/Images/Categorical_Bar_Chart.png)
  
As it can be seen in this graph, GMET is able to capture the overall changing manner of observed precipitation at gauge stations. In other words, as the values of observations at different categories increase, their corresponding estimations by GMET also increase. However, the value of this increase especially at rainfall events heavier than 50 mm/day, is not precise enough to reach the observations. This means that GMET is doing well in the range of [0, 50] mm/day though it is underestimating the heavier rainfall events.  

# Section 14: Inside Pixel Gauge Uncertainty (Daily and Monthly)
Purpose of this code is to calculate the uncertainty inside basin. In order to do that, all statistical error measures are calculated for the gauge stations existing in the same pixels. The value of these errors can be considerd as a measure for the inherent uncertainty that already exist within the observed pcp values inside each pixel. The approach of this code, is to firstly find the pixels with more than one gauge inside them. Then, we will start from the first record all the way trough the final one and at each record/gauge, we want to calculate all statistical measures with the time series of the next gauge station(s) in that pixel. For example, say we have 3 gauges at pixel 1. So we have three records in the pi_ga data.frame regarding all three gauges of this pixel. we start from the first gauge/record and will calculate the statistical measures between the 1st & 2nd gauges then the 1st and 3rd gauges. Afterwards, we move to the next record/gauge regarding this pixel which corresponds to the 2nd gauge. Here we just need to calculate the statistical measures between 2nd and 3rd gauges. Finally, for the 3rd record/gauge, we don't need to calculate any statistical measures because all are calculated before. So in this way we will calculate the statistical measures for all pairwise gauge stations within the pixels that are holding more than one gauge. At the end, we will calculate the min-avg-max values of all calculated statistical measures which are representing for the uncertainty that inherently exist inside the basin.

Finally here is the comparison of the inside-pixels uncertainties with the statistical measures of GMET model over Bolivia, at monthly scale:  
```{r echo=FALSE}
    setwd(dir_unc)
    load(file = "In_Pixel_Statistical_Measures_Monthly.RData")
    
    # summerize the data and make Table:

    Max_inpxl = apply(inpxl_stat[,4:8],2,max, na.rm = TRUE)
    Tbl_stD_inpxl = data.frame(Min = round(Min_inpxl,2), Avg = round(Avg_inpxl,2), Max = round(Max_inpxl,2), 
                               row.names = colnames(inpxl_stat[,4:8]))# Table_Stats_Daily: Tbl_stD
    
    # read the GMET statistical results to make a comparison table at the end  
    setwd(dir_stats)
    load(file = "Statistical_Measures_Monthly.RData")
    Avg = colMeans(stats)
    Min = apply(stats,2,min)
    Max = apply(stats,2,max)
    Tbl_stD = data.frame(Min = round(Min,2), Avg = round(Avg,2), Max = round(Max,2), row.names = colnames(stats))# Table_Stats_Daily: Tbl_stD
    
    # this table will be shown in R Markdown when converting to an HTML file
    kable(cbind(Tbl_stD, Tbl_stD_inpxl), format = "html", 
          caption = "Comparing the inherent uncertainty inside pixels with the GMET performance - Monthly scale") %>%
        kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F) %>%
        add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "GMET Performance" = 3, "Uncertainty in Pixels" = 3))
```
  
in above tables, comparing the middle columns of statistical measures (Ave values) from GMET model against the inside pixel uncertainty values, indicates that there is not large room of improvement for the GMET model over Bolivia. In fact the differences and statistical differences between nearby and adjacent gauge stations within similar pixels are almost close to the error values that are calculated for GMET against the observed values. For example in monthly scale, the average correlation coefficient of the gauge stations that are fallen into similar pixels are 0.91 while this value for GMET versus the observations is 0.90. It means that GMET is performing with similar precision of the inside basin observations. In other words, if we add another gauge station in a new position in Bolivia, it may probably record similar values that GMET is estimating and their statistical performances will be similar. For monthly RMSE, the inside basin uncertainty is equal to 25.6 while GMET’s RMSE is equal to 36.43. This means that we should not expect GMET to reach a RMSE value of less than 25.6. That is also the case when looking at monthly MAE metric at which the inside basin uncertainty is equal to 15.62 while that of the GMET is equal to 23.38 mm per day. So it means that at best condition, GMET can reach to the precision of local gauge stations which is about 15.62 mm/day of monthly error value or (monthly rainfall difference) between estimations and observations.
